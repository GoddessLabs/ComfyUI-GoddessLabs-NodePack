## 📦 Installation

This node pack requires `wxPython` for the native folder dialog functionality.

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)

1.  Navigate to your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory.
2.  Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GoddessLabs/ComfyUI-GoddessLabs-NodePack.git
    ```

3.  The necessary dependencies, including `wxPython`, will be automatically installed when ComfyUI starts, as configured in the `__init__.py` script.

### Manual Installation

If automatic installation fails, or for portable ComfyUI versions:

1.  Clone the repository as above.
2.  Install dependencies manually using your local Python executable:

    ```bash
    # For standard environments
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # For portable versions (adjust path as needed)
    ..\..\..\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

| `auto_reload_on_change` | `true`, `false` | Enable or disable the feature that automatically reloads connected nodes when the path changes. |
| `show_reload_button` | `true`, `false` | Show or hide the explicit "Reload Connected Node" button. |

### `append_options.txt`
